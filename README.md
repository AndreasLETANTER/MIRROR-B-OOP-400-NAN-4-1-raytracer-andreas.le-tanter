# RayTracer

The goal of this project is to create a 3D scene with a camera, lights (ambient, point, directional..), spheres, cylinders and planes. Then, we need to render the scene in a .ppm file.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AndreasLETANTER/MIRROR-B-OOP-400-NAN-4-1-raytracer-andreas.le-tanter.git
cd MIRROR-B-OOP-400-NAN-4-1-raytracer-andreas.le-tanter
cmake .
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./raytracer [configuration file] > [output file]
```

- **configuration file** : the path of the configuration file, the file must follow the configuration file documentation
